# CoStar_Property_Data_Scraping

## CoStar Property Data
[CoStar](https://www.costar.com/) is a property research platform providing competitive intelligence for the commercial real estate industry. This project sought to collect over forty attributes of more than 850 multi-family apartment home properties to facilitate unit price modeling in comparable properties. The program achieved the data collection, cleansing, and injection into storage in less than eight minutes start to finish.

## Program Use Prohibited
This program is shared as a portfolio project and is **not** for operational use. Shortly after completing the project, [CoStar](https://www.costar.com/) released an [updated Terms of Use](https://www.costar.com/about/terms-conditions) for the service to explicitly prohibit the operation of this program. I have ceased operating this program and remain in complete compliance with the CoStar Terms of Use today. I am sharing this program solely as a demonstration of my work and capabilties, and the code should not be used or modified in any way.
